# ☄️ U. Simple Stack Refill

## 🤫 Some Story

Idea appeared when my BedWars teammate said he want auto refill, but [Inventory Profiles Next v2.0.10](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/inventory-profiles-next) was crashing in singleplayer (teammate also wanted to train alone), so I tried to fix IPN initially.

It didn't work out, so I decided to develop quickly a simple mod that could _1) Auto; 2) Refill; 3) Without any crashes._

Unfortunately, I failed to get the mod to work on the server within the time allotted to me (~4 hours), so I just published an alpha version, possibly with some bugs.

> hmm, are the first letters of the name just an accident or...?
